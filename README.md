# 8-queens
Solving the 8-queens problem using the Genetic Algorithm

Must have python available on your system in order to run.
To run the 8-queens program execute the python file named "eightQueens"
  
  python eightQueens.py
 
I did not implement a way for the user to change the population or number
of iterations. The program will ask if the user wants to read how the 
program runs, if they do they need to enter "y" or "Y". If they'd rather
skip the instructions then they can hit the enter key. The program will
then run 5 tests automatically, and 1 at the user's discretion.
